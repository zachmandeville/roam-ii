#+title: Wish List


When designing programs, tackling problems, maintain a wish list of function
headers that must be designed to complete the program. Writing down complete
function headers ensures that you can test the portions of the program that are
finished, knowing that the other tests will fail. If your wishlist is empty,
then you should have a complete program where every function is tested and
passing all tests.
