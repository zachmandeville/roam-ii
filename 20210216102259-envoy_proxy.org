#+title: Envoy Proxy

A proxy for edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications.

The messaging service between all your various microservices in a distributed application.  Adds an abstracted, easier-to-reason-about observability to the entire application, and one place to add resilience, authorization, and more.

* Thoughts on envoy
It is a lot more low-level than I initially realized, which makes sense for why it needs conformance.  It is a thing used by end-user applications like [[file:20210222102522-istio.org][Istio]] to enable your service mesh, and I wonder how much people are writing envoy cluster definitions directly when deploying their cluster, or whether this writing is done by developers builidng out end-user services.
