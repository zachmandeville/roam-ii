#+title: protobuf field tags

The most important part of your .proto specification for the machine to pick up.

e.g. with a definition of:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
message example {
 string awesome = 1;
}
#+END_SRC

the field tag is the 1.  the field name, ~awesome~, is useful for the programmer but the tag is what's important for protobuf.

you cannot use the field tags of 19000 to 199999, but gettint there would mean you have 18999 fields in yr def...which is prolly too many?
