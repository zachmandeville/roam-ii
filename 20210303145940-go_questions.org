* ANSWERED Interfaces and default parameters
There is a function I define for a server interface that says it needs a stream, but I don't pass a stream to it.  Seems to be creating it by default.
Why is it called with this arg?  Is it that it's inheriting it from the interface, or is it how it's defined in the signature?
* For loops
You don't need to have a value givent o them?  aM seeing the for loop with the iteration defined /within/ the loop.  This seems strange to me!
* Responses versus return values
In the client streaming it only returns an error, but it is sending a response each time.  not sure how that isn't a return value.  but this feels just non-functional to me.
