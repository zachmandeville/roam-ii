#+title: envoy client configuration

#+begin_quote
Currently, the client is expected to be given some local configuration that
tells it how to obtain the Listener and Cluster resources. Listener resources
may include a ConfigSource that indicates how the RouteConfiguration resources
are obtained, and Cluster resources may include a ConfigSource that indicates
how the ClusterLoadAssignment resources are obtained.

This is referring to a client communicating with a management server, that would
have a listener and an assigned port. What is the shape of this client nad the
config source?
