#+title: doom RSS Feed

This is how to set up an RSS feed for doom emacs!

* turn on RSS in our init.el
we'll uncomment rss with the +org plugin, so that we can manage the feed in an easy to read org file.
* create an elfeed.org file in our our directory
I am making one in our[[https://github.com/ii/org][ ii/org repo]]

* Useful keybindings
You can move through the list with vim keybindings
=RET= will open up an article
if you select an article with v (or a group of articles) then you can hit ~U~ to mark them as unread or ~u~ to mark them as read.
~s~ will bring up the search filter
