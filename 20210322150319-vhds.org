#+title: VHDS

Virtual Host Discovery Service. Part of [[file:20210216102259-envoy_proxy.org][Envoy Proxy]] v2 [[file:20210322140209-xds_api.org][xDS API]].

optional API that is most useful for larger clusters. With [[file:20210322140721-rds.org][RDS]], all routes for a
cluster are sent to every envoy instance. As the cluster scales up, this can
cause performance issues mostly with dealing with virtual host configuration.
Since not every virutal host will be needed on a request, the VHDS allows for a
specific route configuration to be subscribed to and its set of virtual hosts to
be sent.
