#+title: pipe

a method for communicating through different parts of a process on a CPU.  They are part of a single CPU or [[file:20210323092943-host.org][Host]], and deal with the input output stream of a process (think of how data moves through unix pipes).

Compare to [[file:20210330151520-socket.org][socket]], which is for communicating across the OSI model...which could be communicating streams of data between different [[file:20210323092943-host.org][Host]]s or part of the same one, whereas pipes will be contained on a single [[file:20210323092943-host.org][Host]].
