#+title: HTTP/2

* What is http/1?
- released in 1997
- opens a new TCP connection at each request
- does not compress headers (all plaintext)
- works with request/response (no server push).
- originally composed of two commands:
  - GET
  - POST
- headers are sent at every request.
- as sites get more complex with more assets, http/1 will slow down due to amount of requests and size of requests required.

* What is http/2?
https://http2.github.io/
