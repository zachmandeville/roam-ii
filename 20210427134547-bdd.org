Behaviour Driven Development
https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/
* Three Steps
** Discovery
First, take a small upcoming change to the system – a User Story – and talk
about concrete examples of the new functionality to explore, discover and agree
on the details of what’s expected to be done.
** Formulation
Next, document those examples in a way that can be automated, and check for
agreement.
** Automation
Finally, implement the behaviour described by each documented example, starting
with an automated test to guide the development of the code.
