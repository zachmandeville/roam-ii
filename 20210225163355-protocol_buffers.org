#+title: protocol buffers

a data exchange format (compare it to json or csv).  It is fully typed, read by any language, and easy to read.
you create it by making a proto file that has your api contract define.  this is compiled into a proto3 object which is then encoded and decoded across the network

a basic proto buffer would look like

#+BEGIN_SRC c
syntax = 'proto3';

message getMessage {
  string  greeting id = 1;
  int32   time     id = 2;
  boolean cool     id = 3;
}
#+END_SRC


defautl values should always be handled with care in yr code.
