#+title: proto repeated fields


in your [[file:20210225163355-protocol_buffers.org][protocol buffers]] definition, you can set a repeated field, which is like an array in json.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
syntax = 'proto3';

message Father {
  string name = 1;
  repeated string children = 2;
}
#+END_SRC

this def would let you put down multiple child strings for a Father type.
