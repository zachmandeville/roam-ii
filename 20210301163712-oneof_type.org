#+title: oneof type

you can create a type in [[file:20210225163355-protocol_buffers.org][protocol buffers]] of ~oneof~ which means "it will be one of these things"`:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
message example {
  oneof my_thing {
   string name = 1;
   boolean bool = 2
  }
}
#+END_SRC

be aware that you cannot repeat oneof's and they can be hard to evolve, so use them only where you really need to.
