* Feedback
** Should we show the creation of a box on pair?
** Does the sonobuoy section need to be live?
what benefit is there to showing the code execution?

** If we aren't showing the db live,  is it better to use a fake endpoint and increased coverage?
** What is the core messaage of the presentation?
If it' a broad survey, then we can breeze quickly through everything.
If it is a: "this is how we test", then let's do more hands-on?
