*** DONE See practicality of adding tooltips
The intention is to be able to add definitions to an org file, these definitions then give a handy short summary of the term with maybe an additional link someone can follow.  This makes us able ot more concisely write our articles.

Initial pass would be to have a ~[def:]~  style link that includes word and longer definition all inline.  Second pass would be to reference a ~glossary.org~ within this repo where that word is defined and use that instead.  This is preferred, as we can define once and have multiple links to that definition.

I am going to work on the tufte.el file as it is the simplest written and I think I can add to it easy enough.
it is hard to do as a global package, but could be done as a file local variable i do think
