#+title: 2021 Presentation

* Title
* Who We Are
* Kubernetes Conformance
** Consistent behaviour across providers
** Easy to browse conformant providers through landscape
** For vendors: simple way to test conformance and request certification
* Conformance as Code
Because conformance is defined in code, you can build tools to support conformance that fit easily into the k8s ecosystem and pipelines
For example, tools to help vendors get conformance certification
* Conformance Certification with Sonobuoy
** What it is sonobuoy and where to get it
** Steps for certification:
- run sonobuoy on your cluster
- inspect the output logs, confirm you are conformant
- submit the logs in a PR to the conformance REPO
- await certification
* Improving Conformance Coverage with APISnoop
For the certification to have value, we want to ensure the conformant endpoints
are relaible and consistent. We do this through conformance tests.
Goal is to:
- identify gabs
- fill gaps
- prevent new gaps
We do this through APISnoop

** snoopDB
[[https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/blob/master/apps/snoopdb/tables-views-functions.org#basic-database-setup][Database Setup]] Schemas:
- public :: from k/k [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/api/openapi-spec][swagger.json]]
- conformance :: CI job [[https://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-latest/1319331777721929728/artifacts/bootstrap-e2e-master/][api-audit.logs]]
- testing :: from live in-cluster usage

#+begin_notes
How can I deploy snoopdb in my cluster and ask my own questions about the API shape and usage?
#+end_notes
* Closing gaps in Kubernetes Conformance Coverage
**  Our test writing flow
- custom query to find untested endpoints
- write go code and execute it on the cluster
- use snoopdb to see if this code hit expected endpoints
- see projected change in coverage
- export as PR

#+begin_notes
This job will help us notify sig-release that there is a new API that must have Conformance Tests OR be reverted before a release can happen.

* Conclusion - Conformance is a great initiative with benefits for vendors and consumers - We can use awesome tools like Sonobuoy and APISnoop to validate clusters and strengthen conformance
* Q&A
