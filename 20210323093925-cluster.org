The way envoy interacts with clusters is a good overview of its capability/api.

Envoy discovers a member of a cluster through [[file:20210323094240-service_discovery.org][service discovery]].

Envoy optionally determines the health of a cluster through active [[file:20210323100338-health_checking.org][health checking]].

Envoy determines which cluster member to route the request to through load balancing policy.
