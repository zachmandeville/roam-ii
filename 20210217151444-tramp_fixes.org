#+title: tramp fixes

Tramp is a way to run code on remote machines.  It's used in org-mode shell blocks when you set the dir to a remote dir.

I found it really slow, until I disabled projectile-mode in y file.  Then it worked great!

I like projectile-mode though, I wonder if there's other ways to speed it up?
